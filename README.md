This year has been a strong period of learning, growth, and meaningful contribution. I successfully completed my onboarding and actively participated in training programs focused on Finance, Global Payments, Liquidity, and Generative AI, which provided a solid foundation for understanding both the business and technology aspects of our work.

I contributed to the GenAI use case for Bulk Cancellation and Bulk Routing, gaining valuable exposure to automation opportunities and innovation in banking technology. Additionally, I developed a deeper understanding of the Payments Operator system, including key concepts like SWIFT truncation, value date handling, and high-value transaction processing.

Through our UPI application demo presented to leadership, I demonstrated teamwork, initiative, and technical application skills. I consistently met all Risk Overlay expectations, maintaining accuracy, compliance, and adherence to organizational standards.

Looking ahead, I aim to further strengthen my expertise in banking domain knowledge and technology integration, focusing on tools like LangChain, LangGraph, PyQt5, FastAPI, Flask, and Pub/Sub, while aligning with the companyâ€™s expectations to learn and grow, execute with excellence, and contribute to a collaborative, high-performing environment.
