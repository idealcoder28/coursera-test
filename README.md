Hey guys,

Yesterday at DSU, Gowtham and Nikhil walked us through the payments operator code and gave a brief overview of bulk cancellation and bulk routing. They mentioned that they’ll go into more detail on Monday. In the meantime, they asked us to do a few things:

1. Come up with an idea or a small feature that can be added or updated in the payments operator.


2. Build a small command in the chatbot that does something, even if it’s minor—for example, triggering a Windows notification.


3. Study the code related to value date and SWIFT truncation.



Not sure if they’ll check this on Monday, but this is what they discussed on Friday.
