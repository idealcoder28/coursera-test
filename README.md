As I continue my journey within the organization, my key areas of focus will revolve around enhancing both domain and technical expertise to contribute more effectively to strategic initiatives and team goals.

I plan to build a deeper understanding of core banking concepts, particularly in Finance, Payments (CCIBT), and Liquidity Management, to strengthen my ability to connect technology with business outcomes. Developing a stronger foundation in these areas will help me make more informed contributions to ongoing and future projects.

From a technical perspective, I aim to expand my proficiency in emerging technologies, especially those relevant to our Generative AI initiatives such as LangChain, LangGraph, PyQt5, Python, Grafana, FastAPI, Flask, and Pub/Sub systems. Additionally, I plan to leverage tools like GitHub Copilot more effectively to enhance productivity and code quality.

A continued area of focus will be to actively contribute to the GenAI team’s Bulk Cancellation and Bulk Routing use case, supporting the design, implementation, and refinement of solutions that improve operational efficiency and scalability.

In alignment with the Company Expectations for 2025, I will strive to:

Embrace candor by engaging in open, transparent communication within the team.

Do what’s right by maintaining integrity and accountability in all tasks.

Be great at execution by focusing on delivering quality outcomes within timelines.

Learn and grow through continuous upskilling and application of new technologies.

Champion an inclusive environment by valuing diverse perspectives and collaboration.

Support high-performing teams by contributing positively to team objectives and shared success.


Overall, my goal for the upcoming year is to bridge domain knowledge with technical innovation, ensuring that my contributions drive meaningful impact for both our team and the organization.
