“Create a clean, modern UPI payments app homepage with a fixed top navbar, a large user profile card at the top (showing avatar, username, UPI ID, balance), quick action icons for send/receive/scan/pay bills/recharge/request money, a highlighted ‘Make a Payment’ card with UPI ID and amount input, a recent transactions section showing payee, amount, and status, and a simple footer with support links. Keep the layout similar to a banking site with sections stacked vertically, but no images — only clean cards, icons, text, and buttons. Use soft background colors, rounded cards, clear spacing, and modern typography. Responsive for mobile and desktop.”
