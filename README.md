This year marked my successful onboarding and integration into the organization. I actively participated in the induction program and various training sessions that deepened my understanding of the banking domain, especially in Finance, Global Payments, and Liquidity.

I completed comprehensive learning modules and hands-on sessions on Generative AI, gaining valuable insights into how AI solutions can be leveraged within banking operations. As part of our team use case, I contributed to exploring GenAI-based solutions for Bulk Cancellation and Bulk Routing, identifying potential efficiency improvements and automation opportunities.

Additionally, I developed a strong understanding of key components of the Payments Operator system, including SWIFT truncation, value date handling, and high-value transaction processing.

To strengthen my technical and presentation skills, I also participated in a technology familiarization project, where our team designed and demonstrated a UPI application prototype. This project was presented to leadership and received positive feedback for its innovation and clarity.

Throughout the year, I have demonstrated initiative, collaboration, and a learning-oriented mindset, ensuring consistent progress in both domain and technical areas.
